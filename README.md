# ParrotOS-on-WSL2
Step through of installing Parrot SecOS on WSL2

## Sumary
I have struggled to find a good guide on running Parrot SecOS in the WSL environment (yeah I know there is a Kali WSL, but we humans are creatures of habit) so I decided to publish my first github.  I think I will leave this here as a summary and then create 2 more files (Directions and Checklist) I am open to any comments you may have to help improve my InfoSec posture.
