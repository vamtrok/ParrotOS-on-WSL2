# ParrotOS-on-WSL2
# Directions

First, thank you to the following sites on guiding me through:
Installing WSL2 (https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-wsl2-windows-10)
MS documentation supprint the above(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
ParrotSec OS guide to install on WSL2(https://community.parrotsec.org/t/parrot-on-wsl2/14898)
Additional documentation for ParrotOS on WSL2 (https://exploits.run/parrot-wsl/)

## Prepare your Windows 10 machine
Start by adding the Windows Subsystem for Linux in the Programs and Features on your Windows 10 box, **NOTE** you must be running:
>Windows 10, updated to version 2004
>Build 19041 or higher.
>64-bit Machine (for Kernel Update)

For proper sanity sake **REBOOT**

Open up PowerShell as admin (All PowerShell references, will be "Powershell as admin", I will shorten this to PAA)
`dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart`

Next enable the Virtual Machine Platform
`dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart`

Download the latest WSL2 kernel and install it.
This is the link to the latest kernel via the Microsoft article earlier
(https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi)

**REBOOT**

Open up Powershell (PAA) and set the default version of WSL to 2
`wsl --set-default-version 2`

Now off to Microsoft Store and grab your preferred distro, I prefer to use **Debian** so that is what my instructions will reflect.
Launch the distro when it is downloaded and then provide a user if you desire, (if you escape out of it, you will have a default user of root.)
Close the app (distro) window

If you recieve the following error: **"Error 0x80370102"** this is either 2 things that I gather.
1. You need to enable virtualization on your BIOS
2. You are trying this on a VM (I have no answer to this yet)

Now check to make sure the WSL is defaulted to version 2
Open up powershell as admin (just in case we need to change the version)

`wsl --list --verbose`

  NAME      STATE           VERSION
* Debian    Stopped         2

If you are not on version 2, you can force it with the following command 

wsl --set-version <distribution name> <versionNumber>  (In my example this would be "wsl --set-version Debian 2")

Now that you are on version 2 open the distro app and perform an update and upgrade

'sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade'

When that is finished, grab these packages (thanks to https://exploits.run/parrot-wsl/ if you don't have the gnupg, the script fails)

'sudo apt install wget curl gnupg -y'

I would advise you add a new DNS or change to a public DNS (Subsystem in Windows, tries to DNS query through the host machine which causes some of the parrot-install script)
If you have never changed your DNS then you just need to edit /etc/resolv.conf and add something like
>nameserver 8.8.8.8
>nameserver 1.1.1.1

Now back to the (https://community.parrotsec.org/t/parrot-on-wsl2/14898) the sections that starts Debian -> Parrot

>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ParrotSec/alternate-install/master/parrot-install.sh -o parrot-install.sh
>chmod a+x parrot-install.sh
>sudo ./parrot-install.sh

I chose 1 to let it install the core (there were a few packages missed but you can ignore them for now)

Change the deb mirror to a more current one 
'deb https://mirror.wdc1.us.leaseweb.net/parrot rolling main contrib non-free`

?Parrot install again?

Perform another update and upgrade, this should take some time as it installs all of the rolling packages
`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade'

After that I went to the next step which was to install the parrot tools
`sudo apt-get install parrot-interface parrot-interface-full parrot-tools-full`

Once that is done then the full security tools (large download over 16GB)
`sudo apt -y --allow-downgrades install parrot-interface parrot-interface-full parrot-tools-full`
You will go through some questions on configurtion for different packages, answer as you need.

Now that is done, I'm sure you want to install a visual client, so xRDP
